# toptechstocks
An analysis of the performance of top tech company stocks being publicly traded.  The companies of focus in this analysis are: Apple, Alphabet (formerly Google), Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook), and Microsoft. 

<br>
This report assesses the exponential trends in these big tech stocks that are publicly traded on the Nasdaq. Descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive statistics and analyses were done on each of the five stocks. The data science modeling include trend analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data visualization was also used to illustrate data on closing bell share prices, high trade volumes, and stock splits, for each of the five stocks. Despite the differences in the time and date of when tech stocks went public, the stocks' prices have seen positive exponential growth over time. This especially was true since the 2010s despite corporate controversial decisions, economic or health crises, or because of competition between these companies that often rely on each other to maximize their profits

The stock data is available through the Nasdaq but also available on [this Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/footballjoe789/us-stock-dataset).
